PROJECT ABANDONED
=================
I have abandond this project. I wrote this while I was less expeirenced with scripting, and (Arch) Linux in general. [This itself was a quality rewrite.](https://github.com/LordRusk/old_SAI) I had to do more then a qualirt rewrite for this. The new equivelent is [Art Wizard](https://github.com/lordrusk/art-wizard). Go check it out and support.


SAI - Simple Arch Install
==============================
SAI is the simple way to get a minimal Arch install. It is intended to make it easy to install and configure arch, and do it efficently at that.
Not only is it great for complete reinstalls, it can easily handle just reinstalling your root partition, leaving the rest alone, and a lot more.


How To
------
After you boot from an arch usb, run these commands once connected to the internet:
  pacman -Sy git
  git clone https://www.github.com/lordrusk/sai
  sh sai/sai
LPI uses slmenu and dash because they are efficient, suckless, and easy to work with.


End result
----------
The end result will be a system you can completely build from the ground up. The only things left installed are base, linux, linux firmware, and pacman. That's it. Optionally network manager and its dependencies will be installed and enabled, same with sudo. But as a principle, SAI (or any arch install helper) shouldn't install unnecessary packages.

Support
-------
SAI supports EFI and non EFI bios, optional self drive configuring (expects you to know basic linux commands) or nuking the drive and installing from the ground up, optional grub installation, user creation and setting of root password, sudo installation and editing of /etc/sudoers file, and installation and enablation of NetworkManager.
